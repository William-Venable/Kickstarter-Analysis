# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

Given the task of analyzing Louise's data on Kickstarters, we were able to assess multiple factors, like Category/Subcategory Statistics, Outcomes Based on Launch Date, Successful/Failed US Kickstarters, and finally summarize our statistics finding the Mean, Median, STD, Upper/Lower Quartile, and IQR for Kickstarter Goals/Pledges.

Based on my findings, it seems like Louise is on the right track, theater/plays seem to have the highest success rate.
