# Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Goals

Purpose:
Using the data provided by Louise for her Kickstarter Analysis, we are able to find the outcomes for Theater/Plays based on the starting date as well as their goals.

Analysis:
Firstly, looking at the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date, we can tell that May and June had the most successful round of Kickstarters throughout the years, but with close to a 60% fail rate throughout the rest of the months.

If we look at the Outcomes based on Goal, we can tell that the success rate and fail rate seem to fluctate through the different price ranges, starting off with a high success rate with a lower goal, but as the goal increases, we start to see a higher fail rate. There is however a small pop between the 35000 to 40000 range.

As far as challenges go, I wouldn't say I really had any, other than maybe the time consumption of editing the same formula for different rows and columns. I did make that somewhat a bit more efficient though by copying the same function and just changing minor details.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, Theater Kickstarters seem to have a higher success rate in the months of May and June. However, another conclusion I've come to is that as the years go on, the fail rate also seems to increase; filtering the years to only show 2009-2013, the failed kickstarters only seem to appear after those years.
As far as the Outcomes based on Goal, it would seem that the lower the goal of the kickstarter, there will be a higher chance of success, specifically from the <1000-10000 range and the 35000-40000 range.
Looking back at the two datasets, there might be some limitations because we are unable to filter by country which would refine our data and maybe give us more specific data, as well as the ranges for the goals could maybe be more specific to really breakdown the starting point and end point for more successful kickstarters. We could also create a dataset based on the backers.
We could possibly come up with a table based on the Outcomes by Country, or maybe even Outcomes by the number of Backers.
